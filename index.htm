          <h1 id="personName">Adrian Petre</h1>

          <p>
            I am a multidisciplinary professional with over 13 years of
            experience spanning the energy and technology sectors. My journey
            has been one of constant growth, adaptability, and innovation,
            combining hands-on field expertise with sourcing and advanced
            technical integration capabilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started my career as a Petroleum Engineer with OMV Petrom, where I
            honed my skills in production optimization, field auditing, and well
            analysis. I then transitioned into offshore operations, gaining
            invaluable experience as a Roustabout and later as a Roughneck in
            challenging environments across the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas.
            During this time, I developed a deep understanding of drilling,
            casing, and cementing operations, as well as fostering effective
            communication between multinational teams.
          </p>
          <p>
            Building on this foundation, I pivoted into procurement roles with
            Schlumberger, specializing in procurement of oil and gas equipment.
            Over 4 years, I drove cost-saving initiatives, negotiated
            multimillion-dollar contracts, and optimized supply chain processes.
            My strategic procurement expertise resulted in significant savings
            while maintaining operational excellence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I excel as a Sr. Technical Integration Engineer at
            Tradeshift, blending my engineering background with cutting-edge
            technology to streamline data exchange processes for complex
            systems. My role involves not only technical execution but also
            client advisory, enabling businesses to digitize processes and
            maximize efficiency. With a strong focus on scalability, security,
            and innovation, I bridge the gap between complex technical
            challenges and impactful business outcomes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout my career, I have demonstrated a unique ability to
            integrate field experience with cutting-edge technology, driving
            solutions that deliver measurable value. Whether in the field, at
            the negotiation table, or behind a screen, I bring a relentless
            commitment to excellence, collaboration, and continuous improvement.
